# LancerLogin Carpool plugin

Carpool is an optional staff workspace for planning rides to and from an event: participants, drivers and seats for each direction, ride groups, a map of pickup locations and a shareable schedule. It works with or without Attendance and Outreach.

This repository is a LancerLogin module plugin (module ID `carpool`). LancerLogin composes it into an installation's own build at an exact commit. See LancerLogin's `docs/MODULE-PLUGINS.md` for how plugins are selected, composed, updated and removed.

## Selecting the plugin

Carpool is opt-in. An installation includes it only by listing it in the `lancerlogin.modules.json` file of its private deployment repository.

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "modules": [
    { "id": "carpool", "source": "https://github.com/isriah/lancerlogin-carpool.git", "commit": "<full 40-character commit SHA>" }
  ]
}
```

- Pins are always full commit SHAs. Tags and branches are refused. Choose a release, then pin the commit it points to.
- From a LancerLogin Core checkout, `npm run plugins:resolve -- --selection path/to/lancerlogin.modules.json --track stable --module carpool` writes the commit of the newest stable release into the selection. Use `--track beta` or `--track nightly` for the other tracks.
- This repository is public, so the deployment repository needs no token to fetch this plugin. `LANCERLOGIN_PLUGIN_TOKEN` only matters for private plugins.

## Compatibility

| Plugin | LancerLogin Core | Module contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0.x | `>=2.0.0-beta.11 <3.0.0` (Modular 2.0.0-beta.11 and later 2.x releases) | 1 |

The supported Core range is the `lancerlogin.core` field in `package.json`. Composition refuses this plugin for a Core outside that range, before an installation build or web update starts. React, Leaflet and `@lancerlogin/module-sdk` are peer dependencies provided by Core.

## Release tracks

Releases follow the same rules as LancerLogin itself. The highest version wins, never the most recent publication.

| Track | Tags | Offered to | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | `vX.Y.Z` | Stable, Beta and Nightly | Production installations |
| Beta | `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, GitHub prerelease | Beta and Nightly | Installations that opted in to early releases |
| Nightly | `vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD`, GitHub prerelease | Nightly only | **Test installations only** |

- `1.1.0-beta.10` follows `1.1.0-beta.9`, and `1.1.0` follows every `1.1.0-beta.N`.
- A nightly sorts below every beta of the same version and is never offered to the Stable or Beta tracks. Nightly builds come straight from `main`, have generated notes and receive no review beyond automated verification. Never pin one on an installation people depend on.
- Published releases are immutable. A tag is never moved or reused, and a published release is never replaced.

Patch notes for each stable and beta release are in [docs/releases](docs/releases/README.md); [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) summarizes every release.

## Continuous integration

**Verify** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main`, every pull request and on demand. It checks out the LancerLogin Core commit pinned in `.github/plugin-release.json` from the private `isriah/LancerLogin-modular-dev` repository, composes this plugin commit into it and runs Core's acceptance module gate for `carpool` (`npm run verify:module -- acceptance carpool`): the plugin's Core-side tests, browser specs, typechecks and builds. Plugin tests cannot skip in CI.

Required repository secrets (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**):

- `LANCERLOGIN_CORE_TOKEN`: a fine-grained personal access token with **Contents: read** on `isriah/LancerLogin-modular-dev`, the private Core repository. Without it, Verify fails at its first step with an error that names this secret. Public plugin repositories that Core composes, including the official Outreach plugin, need no token.
- `LANCERLOGIN_PLUGIN_TOKEN` (optional): read access to private plugin repositories Core composes. It defaults to `LANCERLOGIN_CORE_TOKEN`.

To test against a newer Core, update `core.commit` in `.github/plugin-release.json` in its own pull request.

Run the same gate locally from a clean commit with a Core checkout beside it: `npm run verify:core -- ../LancerLogin-modular-dev` (add `--mode fast` for the logic tests only). The plugin's own release-policy tests run with `npm test`.

## Releasing

1. On `main`, set `package.json` `version`, add `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` (title `# LancerLogin Carpool plugin vX.Y.Z`, a short summary, then **Bugs fixed**, **Features added** and **Features removed**, writing `None.` for an empty section) and a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Commit them as `Release vX.Y.Z`.
2. Wait for **Verify** to pass for that exact commit on `main`.
3. Tag the commit and push the tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z <commit>` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. **Release plugin** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) checks the version, notes, changelog and release commit, requires the successful Verify run for that exact commit, and prepares a draft release with the patch notes.
5. Publish from a checkout of this repository with your GitHub CLI login: `node scripts/plugin-release.mjs publish vX.Y.Z` to check, then `node scripts/plugin-release.mjs publish vX.Y.Z --publish`. Publication requires immutable releases to be enabled, rechecks the tag, commit, Verify run and notes, publishes beta releases as prereleases, and makes a stable release Latest only when it is higher than the current Latest.
6. Installations adopt the release by updating their pin, for example with `npm run plugins:resolve`.

**Nightly plugin build** (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) runs daily and on demand from `main`. It publishes `vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD` only when `main` has commits that are not in any release and Verify passed for that exact commit. Its version is above every stable and beta release, so the Nightly track always offers it, and its notes list the commits since the previous release. It never becomes Latest.
